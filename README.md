# Classification of Student performance 

I use the DataSet to classify the student for example who would pass and who would fail and classified the grades into 5 groups A,B,C,D,F





note: 
I modified the Dataset files from CSV to xlcs to view the data easier and separated
You could yous any visualisation not only bosplots or heatMap matrix , you could choose any apprpriate visullasation technique to view the data
